A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter already setup with TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint and Rebass.

## Getting Started

Use [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to create a new Next.js app based off this repo:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app -e https://github.com/alexturpin/nextjs-starter
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
